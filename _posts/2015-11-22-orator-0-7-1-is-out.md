Orator 0.7.1 is now out. This version improves collections, fixes relationships behavior and
the old way of declaring relationships is now deprecated.
It also brings other minor fixes and improvements.

For the full list of changes, see the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/sdispater/orator/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

## Collections

Collection are now largely improved with the addition of several methods.

For the complete list of methods, please refer to the corresponding [documentation section](/docs/collections.html)

## Deprecation of relationship methods on Model

When the 0.7 version was released it had been announced that the old way of declaring
relationships would still be supported, this is no longer the case as of this version
and using relationship methods will generate a deprecation warning. You should update
you models to use the relationships decorators added in version 0.7.

## Improvements and fixes

##### Fixes

* [#22](https://github.com/sdispater/orator/issues/22) Model.fill() and other methods now accept a dictionary in addition to keyword arguments.
* MySQL charset config value was not used when connecting. This is now fixed. (Thanks to [@heavenshell](https://github.com/heavenshell))
* Dynamic properties called the wrong methods when accessing the related items.

    For example:

    ``` python
    comment = Comment.first()
    comment.post.update(title='My Post')
    ```

    would call `BelongsTo.update()` instead of `Post.update()`.
    This has been fixed.
